The goal: uploaded video should serve as a good video-reply in many situations. 

The rules below are intended to fulfill it.

1.  **Format.** MP4.
2.  **Size.** Video should be small. Recommended size is under 500 KB. Acceptable around 1 MB. No one likes to wait long to load.
3.  **Duration.** Video should be rather small. Preferably under 10 seconds. No one likes to watch long vide-replies. 
4.  **Quality.** Prefer video with better quality, but respect items 2. and 3. above.
5.  **Languages.** Allowed are English, Russian, Ukrainian. Others can be subject of additional approval by moderator.
6.  **Content.** The video (and a phrase in it) should be the most generic so as to be applicable as video reply in more situations. Thus sometimes it makes sense to cut a long phrase to be shorter and so more universal.
7.  **Content.** If initial video contains two or more people having conversation, you should cut the part of it with only one person in it. Otherwise it wonâ€™t serve good role as a video reply.
8.  **Quality.** Cut video with precision such that only relevant span captured in it and some unwanted frames/sounds not be included at start and end.   
9.  **Duplicates.** You should make sure not to upload a duplicate video. Play with inline bot + keywords to check if a video is already there. TODO add an option to upload in better quality
10. Failing to comply with the rules above could be a subject for video removal by moderator.
11. By using this service you agree that moderator has a right to remove a video without explanation.

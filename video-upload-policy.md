The goal: uploaded video should serve as a good video-reply in many situations. 

The rules below are intended to fulfill it.

1. **Format.** MP4.
2. **Size.** Video should be small. Recommended size is under 500 KB. Acceptable around 1 MB.
3. **Duration.** Video should be rather small. Preferably under 10 seconds.
4. **Languages.** Allowed are English, Russian, Ukrainian. Others can be subject of additional approval by moderator.
5. **Content.** The video (and a phrase in it) should be the most generic so as to be applicable as video reply in more situations. Thus sometimes it makes sense to cut a long phrase to be shorter and so more universal.
6. **Content.** If initial video contains two or more people having conversation, you should cut the part of it with only one person in it. Otherwise it wonâ€™t serve good role as a video reply.
7. **Duplicates.** You should make sure not to upload a duplicate video. Play with inline bot + keywords to check if a video is already there. TODO add an option to upload in better quality
8. Failing to comply with the rules above could be a subject for video removal by moderator.
9. By using this service you agree that moderator has a right to remove a video without explanation.
